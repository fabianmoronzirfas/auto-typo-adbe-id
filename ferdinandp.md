The cmyk_colors.jsx script creates a colour chart for CMYK colors. It can be used to print a color chart for your specific printer with a specific paper you might use freqently. The script can be adjusted by the amount steps per C, M, Y values. Every CMY value creates 6 colors with different K values. You can choose between 1 to 6 steps per C M Y value;  
The script will than create up to 306 colorsheeds with 6 colors.

![TEASER](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/master/FerdinandP/pagenumber_color_gradation_teaser.png)   

The Pagenumber_ color_gradation.jsx script creates pagesnumbers with a color gradation between frist and last number. It uses the aktiv Indesign document.  
It can be adjusted by  
- changing the CMYK value of the color of the first and the last pagesnumber.  
- changing distance of the pagesnumbers from bottom and side of the document  
- changing the font, fontsize and fontweight  
It works with and without facing pages.
