Hi,
---
I'm Constantin ([ce0311](https://github.com/ce0311)), interface design student at University of Applied Science in Potsdam. The following project is the result of the course "typography and automation" by [Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas](https://github.com/fabiantheblind).


TypoFlower 
=====
A small script to generate radial patterns from single letters or words.

Just edit the variables at the top of the script to change its behaviour.

The comments should be self-explanatory - if not, yell at me!
