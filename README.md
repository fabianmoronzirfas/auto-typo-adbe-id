This is the code repository for the FH-Potsdam ;-⟩ project week "Typography & Automation".
The goal was to learn the basics of JavaScript for Adobe applications to apply this in automated layouts and generative art. Bring raw text into shape by rules.  
  
The project begun with an introduction to JavaScript and how it works with InDesign, then project and idea development to follow in individual and group meetings. At the end there was a short presentations. For further info have a look into [the wiki](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/wiki).    
##Results  
The results will be generated from the projects the contributers create.  

##Submodules  
For some of the results there is also a git submodule included. This is the link to the original repo where the code my be developed further.  

##Known Issues and To-Dos  
In a lot of these scripts the authors used specific fonts. So you have to change the fonts to make them work properly.  
Also there could be some issues with pointSize if you use diffrent fonts. Keep a eye on that. If you run into any problems add an [issue over here](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/issues) and we will get back to you with a fix.
