#![AVATAR](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/master/natael/natael.png) Hello

my name is julian ([natael](https://github.com/natael))
and this is my project for "typography and automation".

###[swissd](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/master/natael/swissd.jsx)  

![TEASER](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/master/natael/teaser.png)
with swissd.jsx you can generate a width-fixed typo.  
all you have to do, is to customize the config-object in the script and run it. several customizations are possible:  

+ add a shadow  
+ add shear  
+ add a rotation  
+ improve the contrast of the biggest words  
+ add a vignette (gradient with transparency)  
+ add a perspective (3D)  

see the original repo here [https://github.com/natael/swissd](https://github.com/natael/swissd)
