<p>This is the documentation for the FH-Potsdam ;-⟩ project week "Typography &amp; Automation".
    The goal was to learn the basics of JavaScript for Adobe applications to apply this in automated layouts and generative art. Bring raw text into shape by rules. The project begun with an introduction to JavaScript and how it works with InDesign, then project and idea development to follow in individual and group meetings. At the end there was a short presentations. For further info on how to write JavaScript for Adobe, have a look into <a href="https://github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/wiki">the wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues and To-Dos</h2>  
<p>In a lot of these scripts the authors used specific fonts. So <strong>you have to change the fonts to make them work</strong> properly. <br>
Look for the following code and change it to a font that exists on your system.</p>
{% highlight js %}
app.fonts.item
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Also there could be some issues with pointSize if you use diffrent fonts. Keep an eye on that. If you run into any problems add an <a href="https://github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/issues">issue over here</a> and we will get back to you with a fix. </p>
