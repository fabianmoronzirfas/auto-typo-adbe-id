Hej! 
=====
I'm Sebastian, [skaim](https://github.com/skaim) here on github. I'm studying Interface Design at FH Potsdam. The following script evolved during a workshop on Typography and Automation held by [fabiantheblind](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/) at FH Potsdam.

This script produces an InDesign document illustrating the single characters of the user's first name. The position of these characters (in black) within a matrix is random, as well as the surrounding characters. Direct neighbors (top, bottom, left, right) are depicted in gray. 
The overall composition may be viewed as a reminiscence to the classic game "Minesweeper".
