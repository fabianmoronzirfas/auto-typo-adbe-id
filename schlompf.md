#![AVATAR](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/auto-typo-adbe-id/master/schlompf/schlompf.png) Hi,

i'm Philipp ([schlompf](https://github.com/schlompf)), interface-design student at University of Applied Science in Potsdam. Layout invaders is my project for the workshop "typography and automation" by [Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas](https://github.com/fabiantheblind).

I set out to create a game to be played inside InDesign. After some fiddling around, googling and reading all i could find about the capabilities of indesign scripting language, i had a functioning gameloop and working keyboard input. And about 2 weeks later, layout invaders was playable. It's a space invaders inspired game for InDesign.
